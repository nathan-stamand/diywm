# README

Welcome to DIY With Me! This app is for tracking your projects and their steps all in one place!

This will take a little setup since there's a distinct frontend and backend to start up, so I'll try to keep this relatively simple.

First, you'll want to follow the individual link for diywm-backend on Github and clone the repository.
  
  Open your terminal and find your way to the diywm-backend folder.
  
  To setup your database, enter 'rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development' to the terminal.

  Assuming that went over with no issues, you should be able to enter 'rails s' to run the API for diywm! Easy and fun, right?
  
Now, we'll set up the frontend by following the link for it here on Github and cloning it to your device.

  Open a separate terminal (we need that backend running, after all) and get inside of diywm-frontend, and enter 'npm i'.
  
  Once that's finished, you should be able to enter 'npm start', which will open up in your browser. Time to use the app!
  
It's pretty simple and I'm confident you could figure it out, but here are the basics:

You can create a new project with that little plus sign button on the green left-panel.

From there, you just enter your info in for the project's name, materials, and a little blog explaining the general idea of the project.

After you save, you'll see that bad boy pop up on the green side panel by title.

Clicking on a project opens it in the main pinkish part of the screen. Here you can add steps, edit stuff, anything really.

If you absolutely hate your project, a little delete button is located to the left of it on that green, life-controlling panel. Kill the project! No one can stop you!

That's it! Enjoy!

If you have any problems, please contact me at nathan@nathan-stamand.com and let me know. I appreciate it!
